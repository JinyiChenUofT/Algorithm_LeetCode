# Deque in Python
Deque (Doubly Ended Queue) in Python is implemented using the module “collections“. Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends of container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n) time complexity.

append() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the right end of deque.

pop() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of deque.

popleft() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of deque.
