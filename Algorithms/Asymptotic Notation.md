# Theta Notation (Θ-notation)
    Θ(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0
            such that 0 ≤ c1g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2g(n) for all n ≥ n0 }

# Big-O Notation (O-notation)
    O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0
            such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0 }

# Omega Notation (Ω-notation)
    Ω(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 
            such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
